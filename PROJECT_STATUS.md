## üéØ Critical Implementation Details for Next Steps

### NotificationService Integration Points
```python
# Ready for Discord client injection
notification_service = NotificationService(
    discord_client=discord_client,
    validation_service=validation_service
)

# Message formatting with validation
reminder_message = notification_service._format_reminder_message(reminder)
# Includes user mentions, validation instructions, frequency info

# Validation setup automatic
await notification_service.send_reminder(reminder)
# Automatically adds ‚úÖ reaction and creates validation record
```

### Scheduler Integration Ready
```python
# SchedulerService handles reminder execution
scheduler_service = SchedulerService(reminder_service=reminder_service)
await scheduler_service.schedule_reminder(reminder)
# Uses frequency strategies for precise timing
```

### Key Files for Slash Commands
- `src/commands/reminder_commands.py` - Command handlers needed
- `src/bot/discord_client.py` - Bot entry point needed
- `src/observers/reaction_observer.py` - Reaction handling needed

### Service Dependencies Ready
- ReminderService: Fully tested business logic
- ValidationService: Handles user kicking automatically  
- NotificationService: Discord messaging complete
- SchedulerService: Async task management ready

**The foundation is rock-solid - only slash commands remain for complete MVP!**
